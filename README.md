# 🐍 Python Journey

This repository is a collection of my Python practice materials.  
I already have a solid foundation in Python, but I’m going through it again — to **refresh my knowledge**, improve my **coding style**, and **help others** who might be learning as well.

## About

Here you’ll find various Python topics, organized in a clean and simple structure — from core syntax to more advanced concepts.  
Every folder includes short, focused examples that demonstrate how each topic works in real code.

My main goal is to keep my skills sharp while sharing something useful with the community.

- Python Syntax & Logic
