# Word Analyzer

A simple Python program that analyzes a word entered by the user.

## How it works

1. The user enters a word.
2. The program shows:
   - The word's length
   - The first and last letters
   - The uppercase and lowercase forms
3. As a bonus, it checks if the word is a **palindrome** (e.g., `level`, `madam`).

## Run the project

```bash
python main.py
```
