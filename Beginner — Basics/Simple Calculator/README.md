# Simple Calculator

A simple Python project that performs basic arithmetic operations between two numbers.

## How it works

1. The user enters two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
2. The program calculates and displays the result.
3. Division by zero is checked and handled properly.

## Run the project

```bash
python main.py
```
