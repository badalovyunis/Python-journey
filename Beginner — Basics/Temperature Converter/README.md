# Temperature Converter

A simple Python program that converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## How it works

1. The user enters which scale to convert from (`C` or `F`).
2. Then enters the temperature value.
3. The program automatically converts it to the other scale.

## Run the project

```bash
python main.py
```
